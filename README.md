**Real Estate Price Prediction Web App üè°**

This project is a machine learning-powered web application that predicts real estate prices based on user input. The application allows users to select location, square footage, BHK, and bathrooms to get an estimated property price.

Project Overview
- Data Processing ‚Äì Cleaned and prepared real estate data for model training.
- Model Development ‚Äì Built a price prediction model using Linear Regression with scikit-learn.
- Flask API ‚Äì Developed a backend server to handle predictions.
- User Interface ‚Äì Created a simple UI with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to interact with the model.
- Full Integration ‚Äì The UI sends user inputs to the Flask API, which returns a predicted price instantly.

How It Works:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Flask Server

python server.py

2Ô∏è‚É£ Open the Web App

Open client/app.html in your browser.
Enter square footage, BHK, bathrooms, and location.
Click "Estimate Price" to view the predicted amount.
